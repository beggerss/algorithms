Beggerss' Ultimate Algorithm Repository

I'll be implementing as many canonical CS algorithms as I have time (and motivation) to in Python. Feel free to fork! But don't send pull requests, this is to learn.

The solutions might not be the most efficient--the code will be geared towards readability and pedagogy.

Thanks to EKAlgorithms (github.com/EvgenyKarkan/EKAlgorithms) for the idea and starting list.


Array
----- 
1. Index of maximum element in array. 
2. In-place Array reverse.
3. Intersection of two arrays.
4. Find duplicates.
5. Union of two arrays (with remove duplicates).
6. Array with N unique/not unique random objects.

Search
------ 
1. Linear search.
2. Binary search.

Sort
----
1. Bubble sort.
2. Shell sort.
3. Merge sort.  
4. Quick sort.  
5. Insertion sort.
6. Selection sort.

String
------
1. Palindrome or not.
2. String reverse.
3. Words count.
4. Permutations of string. 
5. Occurrences of each character (a - z).

Number
-------
1. Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Great common divisor (GCD).					(done)
3. Least common multiple (LCM).
4. Factorial.
5. Fibonacci numbers.
