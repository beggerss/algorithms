# Finds prime numbers up to a user-generated value using the Sieve of Eratosthenes
# algorithm. The algorithm starts with an index i = 2. Then, it iteratively adds
# the current index number to the primes set, marks all multiples of it (in a boolean
# array) as non-prime, and increments the index to the next unmarked number. Once
# it reaches sqrt(size), it has marked all non-primes and just iterates through
# the boolean array to find the remaining primes.
