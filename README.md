Beggerss' Ultimate Algorithm Repository
=============================

I'll be implementing as many canonical CS algorithms as I have time (and motivation) to in Python. Feel free to fork! But don't send pull requests, this is to learn.

The solutions might not be the most efficient--the code will be geared towards readability and pedagogy.

Thanks to EKAlgorithms (github.com/EvgenyKarkan/EKAlgorithms) for the idea and starting list.
