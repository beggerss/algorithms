beggerss' Algorithm Repository
=============================

I'll be implementing as many CS algorithms as I have time (and motivation) to in Python. Some are canonical and well-known, some I just find interesting. Feel free to fork! The only pull requests that I'll accept will be those with more algorithms to add to the list--no solutions!

The solutions might not be the most efficient--the code will be geared towards readability and pedagogy.
